Windows instructions
====================

These instructions have been tested with Inkscape 0.45.1 for Windows.

1. Install a Latex distribution, eg. MikTex_

2. Install Pstoedit_

3. Install Ghostscript_

4. Download the `tcl.zip`_ and copy the ''tcl'' folder inside it to

    c:\Program Files\Inkscape\python

5. Copy textext.py and textext.inx to

    c:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions

This will look quite ugly, and a black terminal window opens every time TexText is used.
However, it should anyway Work(TM).
