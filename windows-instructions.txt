Windows instructions
====================

Inkscape 0.46
-------------

These instructions have been tested with Inkscape 0.46 for Windows.

1. Install a Latex distribution, eg. MikTex_

2. Install Pstoedit_

3. Install Ghostscript_

4. Download and run `Textext installer`_

(Sorry about the blank terminal window that opens while the extension runs, it is forced by Inkscape.)

.. _`Textext installer`: Textext-0.4.exe


Inkscape 0.45.1
---------------

These instructions have been tested with Inkscape 0.45.1 for Windows.

1. Install a Latex distribution, eg. MikTex_

2. Install Pstoedit_

3. Install Ghostscript_

4. Download the `tcl.zip`_ and copy the ''tcl'' folder inside it to

    c:\Program Files\Inkscape\python

5. Copy textext.py, inkex45.py and textext.inx from Textext (no newer than 0.3.3!) to

    c:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions

It will look quite ugly. However, it should anyway Work(TM).
