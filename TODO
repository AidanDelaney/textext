Things to do:

- Preserve styles (color?) when re-editing.
  Strip color-changing attrs from children?

- .inx file format is changed in Inkscape dev version.

- edit cloned object -> original disappears (with pdf2svg)

- pstoedit problems; temp files and permissions on win32?

- substitute ${PATH} with the directory where the processed file is in.
  OR, instruct pdflatex to look stuff in a directory...
